# Memorise-the-pairs
A small python program designed to help you revise and memorise two pieces of logically unrelated data by repeatition &amp; recollection (basically mugging up) in the form of a quiz. I hate this method of learning but is extremely usefull in very niche cases like learning the index of books or important dates and such. Hope this helps some soul out there.
